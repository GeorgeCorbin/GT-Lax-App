The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets Lacrosse Team has cemented itself as a dominant force in the Southeastern Lacrosse Conference (SELC) and on the national stage. After clinching their second consecutive SELC Championship title in 2024 and finishing 7th nationally, the buzz around the program is palpable: Can Georgia Tech win the SELC for a third straight year and make another deep run at the national tournament?

### A Legacy of Excellence

Georgia Tech’s 2024 season was a testament to the program’s strength. With a 14-4 overall record and another SELC Championship added to the trophy case, the Yellow Jackets continued to build on their storied legacy. Their campaign in the national tournament saw them advance to the second round before falling to Utah Valley, a team that went on to become national runner-up. While that loss stung, it served as motivation for this year’s team, which is more determined than ever to take the next step.

### Preseason Recognition: The Road Ahead

The SELC Preseason Coaches Poll has placed Georgia Tech firmly at the top of the Division I rankings, reinforcing the respect the program has earned over the years. Being named preseason favorites is an honor but also a challenge—a target that every other team in the SELC will aim for this spring.

Close on their heels are the South Carolina Gamecocks, who pose a formidable threat. South Carolina handed Georgia Tech a regular-season loss in 2024 and will undoubtedly be seeking redemption after falling short in the SELC semifinals last year. The road to another SELC title won’t be easy, but the Yellow Jackets are up to the challenge.

### Building a Winning Formula

What makes Georgia Tech’s lacrosse program so successful? It’s a combination of factors: a disciplined coaching staff, a talented roster of athletes, and a culture of hard work and resilience. The team’s depth has been a cornerstone of its success, allowing them to maintain a high level of play throughout the grueling SELC schedule and into the national tournament.

This year, the Yellow Jackets are returning key players who will lead the charge, supported by a new wave of talent ready to leave their mark. Their speed, versatility, and commitment to teamwork will be critical in defending their SELC crown and achieving their ultimate goal of a national championship.

### The Championship Question

The 2025 season carries high expectations, and rightly so. Winning a third straight SELC title would solidify Georgia Tech’s dominance in the conference, while another national tournament appearance would give the program a chance to avenge last year’s exit and possibly go all the way. 

Key matchups, particularly against South Carolina and other SELC contenders, will serve as litmus tests for the team’s championship aspirations. But if history is any indicator, the Yellow Jackets thrive under pressure and are more than capable of rising to the occasion.

### The Yellow Jackets Are Ready to Soar

As the 2025 season approaches, one thing is clear: Georgia Tech Lacrosse is not content with past success. They are hungry for more, driven by a commitment to excellence and a vision of hoisting a national championship trophy.

For fans, alumni, and supporters, this season is shaping up to be one of the most exciting yet. The question isn’t just whether Georgia Tech can defend their SELC title—it’s how far this talented team can go on the national stage. One thing is certain: the Yellow Jackets are ready to prove that the best is yet to come. 

Georgia Tech’s journey begins now, and the path to greatness runs through Atlanta. Keep your eyes on the hive—this team is buzzing with potential.
