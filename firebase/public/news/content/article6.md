The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets Men's Lacrosse Team kicked off the 2025 season with back-to-back wins, defeating Florida State on Friday and West Virginia on Sunday at Roe Stamps Field.

### Friday Night Battle Against Florida State

In a rematch of recent SELC tournament clashes, the Jackets wasted no time setting the tone against the Seminoles. Senior **Brooks Baro** opened the scoring just 30 seconds into the game, and despite an early FSU response, Tech surged ahead with four unanswered goals to take a 5-1 lead after the first quarter.

The second quarter saw a shift in momentum as the Jackets struggled to maintain their early rhythm. Tech extended the lead to 7-1 before Florida State capitalized on late opportunities, closing the gap to 7-3 at halftime.

The back-and-forth nature of the game continued in the third, as the Jackets added five goals but allowed six, giving the Seminoles a chance to stay within striking distance. Entering the fourth quarter with a 12-9 lead, Tech held firm despite Florida State's late push. The Seminoles cut the deficit to one, but the Jackets never surrendered their advantage, securing a hard-fought 15-13 victory.

Baro led the charge with a dominant seven-goal, two-assist performance, while freshman **Sam Bueno** controlled the face-off X, winning 16 of 27 draws. Goalie **Owen Armentrout** made 14 crucial saves to help Tech hold on for the season-opening win.

### Sunday Statement Against West Virginia

Two days later, the Jackets returned to action against West Virginia, looking to build on their opening-night success. The Mountaineers, eager for redemption after a loss to Florida State on Saturday, started in a zone defense, briefly slowing Tech's offensive attack. However, the Jackets quickly adjusted, finding their rhythm to race out to a commanding 6-0 lead after the first quarter.

While the offense settled in, the Tech defense—anchored by **Hudson Higgins**, **George Corbin**, and Armentrout—stifled West Virginia's attack, limiting scoring chances throughout the half. By the break, the Jackets had built a 12-2 lead, allowing younger players to gain valuable experience in the second half.

In total, 15 different Yellow Jackets recorded a point as Tech cruised to a dominant 23-9 win, capping off a perfect opening weekend.

With a 2-0 record, the Jackets now shift their focus to their first road test of the season as they travel to face the Auburn Tigers on Friday.
