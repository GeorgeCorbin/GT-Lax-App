Owen, it has been inspirational to see you find the time to do meaningful charity work for youth and at Shepherd Center while carrying both a heavy academic load and playing on the lacrosse team. For those unaware, Shepard is one of the nation's top hospitals for rehabilitation focused on rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injury, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and other neuromuscular conditions.

### Can you describe your charity work?

I am incredibly grateful to be able to volunteer at the Shepherd Center, Emory Hospital, and Northside Surge Lacrosse. At Shepherd, I serve as a volunteer feeder for patients who have quadriplegia, making sure that they are receiving the best possible care at a difficult point in their lives. I also volunteer during family dinners at Shepherd, where patients and their families can bond with each other and play some fun games while they do it. This summer, I also had the opportunity to volunteer at Emory University Hospital in their Ambulatory Surgery Center, helping patients quickly recover from outpatient surgical operations. Finally, as a team, we volunteer with Surge (a rec-lacrosse program) on the weekends; teaching these kids lacrosse in the same program where I learned to play is always so special. 

### How did you get introduced to your various charitable activities and start helping?

I lived across the street from Shepherd in Atlanta, so I knew that it was always something I wanted to give back to. I saw patients and their families walking in my neighborhood and constantly wanted to help. I found Emory's program through our pre-health department at Tech, and I have been volunteering at Surge since I was in 7th grade. Coaching with my dad at Surge was always something I looked forward to, and continuing at tech has been so fulfilling.

### What High School did you attend in Atlanta?

I had the opportunity to attend the Lovett School up in the Vinings area.

### How did you come to play goalie?

I started off playing attack at Surge when I was young, until the goalie for middle school team left. At the time, I was apprehensive about switching to goalie, but it was the best decision I had made while playing lacrosse. 

### How so?

Goalie is one of very few positions in lacrosse where you are on your own little island. I enjoy getting to make my own plays knowing that whenever I make a save, I am helping out the team tremendously. One final thing that made playing goalie such a good decision was using what I learned from the previous 6 plus years of playing in the field and adapting what I knew about that to this new position.

### What do you enjoy about the position?

I love playing goalie because it allows me to see the field differently. You are in charge of the defense, so having the power to throw different defensive sets at offensive players has always allowed for some creativity. I also enjoy the pressure of playing such a high-stakes position.

### What sports other did you play in High School or did you just focus on lacrosse?

I had the opportunity to play lacrosse during the spring, but during the fall ran cross country. It offered a different environment than lacrosse, which I enjoyed.

### How did you decide to go into a technical field, Biomedical Engineering in particular?

When I was applying to college, I knew I wanted to study engineering and hopefully attend medical school after my undergraduate studies. Any engineering degree from Georgia Tech allows for so much flexibility after graduation. With that said, I decided on Biomedical Engineering because of the focus on healthcare I wanted, but still have options post-grad because of my engineering degree. It also helps that it is the 2nd best BMED program in the country!

### What attracted you to Georgia Tech compared to your other options?

Georgia Tech's exceptional engineering programs were what immediately drew me here. Besides the tremendous academic prestige of the school, Atlanta as a city is so much fun to explore. I have lived here for 20 years, and I have seen more of the city in the past two years than in the previous eighteen and loved it. Finally, Georgia Tech has so many amazing opportunities in and outside of the school, whether that is a Power 5 football team, fantastic study abroad programs, or many internship and co-op opportunities that are present here in Atlanta.

### Can you describe your lacrosse and educational experience to date?

Georgia Tech as a school is the perfect balance of a rigorous curriculum with a super supportive environment. School is hard, but everyone wants to see each other succeed. I also wouldn't have wanted to play lacrosse anywhere else. The way our team operates has always been a student first, athlete second mentality, but that doesn't mean we expect anything less than perfection on the field. It just allows for leniency in practices for exams, projects, and research that you couldn't find anywhere else. 

### How do you manage all your activities successfully?

Time management was something that I quickly learned when I came to college—being able to plan out what to do when is a super important skill that I picked up early on here. One thing I found super helpful was leaning on some of the older guys on the team about how to manage everything on my plate, but obviously, school, lacrosse, and volunteering are not everything.

### Owen, maybe you can give an example of what programs at Georgia Tech have helped enable your success to date?

Several programs around Georgia Tech's campus have made school easier and more enjoyable. Joining a fraternity along with the lacrosse team was one decision I will never regret. Instantly having 150 or so friends involved all across campus is super helpful whenever you are trying to get involved or maybe struggling in classes. I also think doing what brings you joy is super important; not everything has to be strictly goal-orientated, and I have found that in the Fly-Fishing Club here on campus.

### What are your hopes and near-term plans or goals for your charitable activities?

Getting people involved in charitable work outside the Atlanta community is always the goal. The more my teammates, my fraternity brothers, and I can do to help, the better. That said, I am trying to get Georgia Tech's campus more involved with the Shepherd Center. One example is bringing my fraternity brothers to help me serve food and connect with patients at Shepherd this October for one of the family dinners. I am working with Shepherd Center and Georgia Tech's Fly-Fishing Club to help out in their annual Shepherd's Soque Slam fishing fundraiser. Finally, I am looking to get the lacrosse team out this spring to host one of these family dinners at Shepherd, along with the work we are already doing with Northside Surge. 

### What does the experience mean to you?

Being able to connect my friends and teammates to something that I care about is amazing, especially when you can see the smiles and pure joy it brings them and the people they are helping.

Owen we are really proud of you and wish you success in all your activities!
