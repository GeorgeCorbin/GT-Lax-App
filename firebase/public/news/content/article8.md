The Jacket seniors are **Jojo Banks**, **Brooks Baro**, **Michael Grosso**, **Hudson Higgins**, **Aaron Piszczek**, **Pierce Quarles**, **Joseph Rose**, and **Brendan Sullivan**.
 
The day was cold and rainy but the Jackets started the game hot. The Jackets scored five goals in the first five minutes of the game. With 10:46 seconds left in the first quarter **Brooks Baro** tied the school's all-time points record of 267 points previously held by Brian Connolly '17. 39 seconds later Baro assisted **Michael Grosso** for an extra man goal to take solo possession of the record. The Jackets finished the first quarter with a 6-1 lead.
 
The Huskies opened the second quarter scoring, but the Jackets rattled off the next five goals, including **Andrew Belli** netting his third of the game, to take an 11-2 lead into half time. The Jacket defense led by **Hudson Higgins** and **George Corbin** was stout all day, turning away the Huskies' attempts at goal. **Charlie Ciardullo** was a force at the faceoff dot winning 9/12 faceoffs.
 
The game slowed down in the second half, but the Jackets maintained control. 
 
Senior **Brendan Sullivan** scored his first career goal in the fourth quarter, while Jojo Banks manned the net and turned away five shots from the Huskies.
 
The Jackets will host the University of Central Florida on Friday before their annual Spring Break off week.
