Florida State and Georgia are on the other side of the bracket, the winner will face Florida.  It will be one of the most competitive tournaments in the MCLA this season with Florida in the top 5 of the MCLA latest National Rankings. Both Auburn and South Carolina started the season slowly with very strong schedules, but are currently two of the hottest teams in the country with Auburn winning its last 5 games including an upset of Florida State and South Carolina winning 6 games in a row including a victory over Texas. Georgia and Florida State have been in the top ten all season and are fighting to keep their hopes for an at-large bid to the MCLA National Tournament alive.
